# Exercise 1: Our First Î¼-service: User Activity

Previously on HOMicS -> [Exercise 0: Monolith](../user-guide/monolith.md)

## Context

In our application, we track user activity upon login and logout. This functionality is already implemented in
the monolith codebase.

In `WebSecurityConfig`, you can find two classes `CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler` and 
`CustomLogoutSuccessHandler`. Those classes implement some **Spring Security** interfaces to define a strategy used to 
handle a successful user authentication or logout. In our case, they call the `UserActivityService` which save the event
in database through it `UserActivityRepository`.

![tip](../img/success.png) you can read more about spring security `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` in the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.11.RELEASE/apidocs/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/AuthenticationSuccessHandler.html). 

The front fetches those events for display through an internal API in `UserActivityInternalController`.

## Goal

We are going to create a new service in charge of logging user activities. Let's be creative and call it: 'user-activity'.
It will store every user activities in its own database and display the information on a dedicated page. The monolith
will call this microservice via API to notify of a successful user login or logout.

## At your keyboards

Checkout the branch:

        git checkout exercise-1

There is a new folder for the user-activity microservice. You are not going to start from scratch but you will need
to implement some of the API.

### 1.1 - User Activity

#### _TODO_ 1.1.1: Save a user's activity

In `UserActivityApiController`, register any activity sent via the new API `/user/api/activity`.

![info](../img/info.png) You will need to use the `@PostMapping` with the `@RequestBody` annotations to extract the right DTO.

![warning](../img/warning.png) The `@RequestMapping` annotation on the class already specifies the URI `/user/api`.

**Checklist**:

1. Run the user-activity project with the following command to access the microservice via [localhost:8080/user/userActivity](http://localhost:8080/user/userActivity):

        mvn spring-boot:run -pl user-activity

    You should see your microservice up. The **User Activity micro** tab works but any other tab returns a 404. It's logic
    since the monolith is the one providing those pages but it isn't up.
    
2. Call the api with the following command to log an activity:

        curl -d '{"username":"Jean Bonbeurre", "activityType":"LOGIN", "activityDate":"2019-04-18T15:00:00.000Z"}' -H "content-type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/user/api/activity
    
3. Check on the [localhost:8080/user/userActivity](http://localhost:8080/user/userActivity) that you can see the new activity that you just sent.

#### _TODO_ 1.1.2: Problem with ports

Start the monolith

    mvn spring-boot:run -pl monolith

![error](../img/error.png) You realize that you have the following error:

    2019-12-25 23:20:56.600 ERROR 10837 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.d.LoggingFailureAnalysisReporter   : 
    ***************************
    APPLICATION FAILED TO START
    ***************************
    Description:
    The Tomcat connector configured to listen on port 8080 failed to start. The port may already be in use or the connector may be misconfigured.
    Action:
    Verify the connector's configuration, identify and stop any process that's listening on port 8080, or configure this application to listen on another port.

The reason is that the two services are started on the same port. Let's change the port for user-activity.

Open the file `application.yaml` and complete the _TODO_ 1.1.2 to change the server port to 9001

**Checklist** :

1. Restart your two apps :
    
        # monolith
        mvn spring-boot:run -pl monolith
        # user-activity
        mvn spring-boot:run -pl user-activity

2. Log in on to the app [localhost:8080/mono/login](http://localhost:8080/mono/login) and go to User Activity micro tab.
You can see the table for the user activities but it's empty. Weird right, since you just logged in.
 
> ![question](../img/question.png) How does the monolith 'talk' with the User microservice?

### 1.2 - Monolith

#### _TODO_ 1.2.1: 

In the monolith app, in the `UserActivityService` class, edit the `post()` method to call the microservice using `restTemplate`.

------

#### _TODO_ 1.2.2:

Use and modify the `UserActivityService` methods `addLogin()` and `addLogout()` previously used save data in database to instead send it to the new microservice, 
using the new `post()` method.

**Checklist** :
    
1. Restart your two apps:
         
        # monolith
        mvn spring-boot:run -pl monolith
        # user-activity
        mvn spring-boot:run -pl user-activity
       
2. Log on the [monolith](http://localhost:8080/mono/login). Navigate to the _User Activity Micro_ tab and you
   should see the same table than before with your activities.

------

#### _TODO_ 1.2.3: Clean the monolith

As a final step, remove any code related to the user activity in the monolith.

![info](../img/info.png) We took care of the front for you.
    
Great, you just created your first microservice and connected it to your monolith. Not too bad.

## List of _TODOs_ locations

1.1.1 - file com.homics.useractivity.controller.UserActivityApiController

1.1.2 - file application.yaml for user-activity

1.2.(1/2/3) - file com.homics.monolith.service.UserActivityService

1.2.3 - below
* file com.homics.monolith.controller.UserActivityInternalController
* file com.homics.monolith.model.UserActivity

## Database

You can access the database console via the following [url](http://localhost:9001/console).

## Results

You should see the following screen.

![user-activity](../img/user-activity-micro.png)

![question](../img/question.png) Did you notice the port number after 'localhost' in the URL? 

![question](../img/question.png) Did you realize that you can access the User Activity microservice on port 9001 without
authentication?

The user navigating on the application can see that we are switching between two ports/applications. We did not copy the
authentication on the new microservice, but we could.

Let's see in the next exercise how to centralize the authentication and to have a single entry point in our application.
